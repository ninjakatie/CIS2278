/* 1) Create class IntegerSet object can hold integers in the range 0-100.  
 * The set is represented by an array of booleans.  Array element a[i] is true if the integer i is in the set.  
 * Array element a[j] is false if integer j is not in the set.  The non-argument constructor initializes the Java array 
 * to the “empty set” (i.e, a set whose array representation contains all false values). Also provide a constructor 
 * that will accept varargs which accepts arbitrary number of integer values.
For example, you can create an IntegerSet object as
 IntegerSet set1 = new IntegerSet(2,5,10,20) which will set the array of location 2,5,10,20 to true.
